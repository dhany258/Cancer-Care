# Cancer Care

Explore my Kotlin-based Android application, Cancer Care, integrating TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) for advanced machine learning. This app performs detailed accuracy analysis and features a comprehensive health news portal dedicated to cancer awareness and information. Through this project, I enhanced my understanding of machine learning integration in mobile apps and created a valuable resource for cancer awareness.

## Features
